Two of the last three overs went for 15 each. Shimron Hetmyer, who should have been out for 2 but was reprieved by a Chakravarthy no-ball, went bang bang against Lockie Ferguson. Then Shreyas Iyer did the trick against Shivam Mavi, a take down that included a six to end the innings on a high note.
Capitals have a decent total here. And they have a more than decent bowling attack. Axar Patel and R Ashwin are spinners well-practiced in the art of tying a batting line-up down. Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada can be menaces in any conditions. More so if they hit the back of a length area - that 8m mark in line with the stumps.
